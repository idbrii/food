[Clark Tank SPECIAL EDITION: Defining, categorizing, and generating "hooks" ](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/555677505). He also talked about this on the Spelunky Showlike podcast.

Ryan Clark had a talk about "hooks" to help design your game for success.

# Hook

Hook: Something surprising about your game that is also something that people want.

A 2D pixel platformer is desirable but not surprising so it doesn't stand out. Rocket League with hotdogs for cars is surprising, but why would people want it?

Preplay and postplay hooks.

## Preplay hooks

People are hooked by seeing the game.

Get wishlists, trailer views, sharing in anticipation, viral gifs.

More than 50k wishlists probsbly improves promotion on steam -- critical mass. 1:00:00

## Postplay hooks

People are hooked by playing the game.

Get word of mouth and recommendations.

# Anchor


> “The Anchor” is the factor that makes your game “familiar” or “safe” to your
> target audience. It is the thing that reduces risk in their mind. The hook is
> what makes your game unique. The anchor is what makes it relate-able. They
> are kinda like the antithesis of each other but more like the ying and yang.
