I was hankering for this soup I had as a child. I remembered it was Jamaican and green and had these great thin dumplings that bobbed up and down. Shanika's [Immune-Boosting Green Veggie Swamp Soup](https://www.orchidsandsweettea.com/immune-boosting-green-veggie-swamp-soup) is the closest I've found and it's fantastic! The dumplings are spheres instead of cylinders, so I'll try a different shape next time.

I've adapted her recipe to what I usually have on hand and increased the amount of dumplings. In the future, I'd like to merge the green seasoning with the soup to make it even simpler.


# Jamaican Green Seasoning

This will make more than enough seasoning for the soup.

Add to a high-powered blender:

* 1 bunch **cilantro**
* 0.5 bunch **parsley**
* 2 **celery** stalks, organic
* 4 **green onions**
* 10 **garlic** cloves
* 8 whole **allspice berries** or 0.25 tsp allspice powder
* 1 **onion**
* handful of fresh **thyme** sprigs
* 1 **scotch bonnet pepper**, only if you like it spicy
* 0.5 **red bell pepper**
* 1 inch **ginger** root, peeled
* juice from 1-2 **limes**
* 0.75 cup filtered **water**

Blend until smooth, about **1-2 minutes**. You may need to add more water.

Refrigerate extras in a well-sealed jar.


# Kale

Add to a large bowl:

* 1 bunch organic **kale**, stems removed + roughly chopped
* Enough **water** to cover the leaves
* 1 tbsp **apple cider vinegar** (or white vinegar)

Soak for **12 minutes**.

Drain. Rinse twice and set aside.

Or skip this step and use **spinach**.


# Green Leaf Broth

Add your green leaves (kale or spinach) to a dutch oven (or other large pot). Add:

* 4 cups **water**

Bring to a boil and cook for **7 minutes** until wilted.

Use a skimmer/spider to scoop the leaves to a bowl of ice cold water to halt cooking. After **3 minutes**, drain and set aside.

Set aside the water in the pot (that you cooked with) for later.


# Soup

Add the reserved cooking water and the cooked green leaves to a blender along with:

* 2 cups **chicken bone broth** or stock
* 1 **green bell pepper**, chopped
* 2 inches **ginger** root, peeled and minced
* 1 **celery** stalk
* 2 **scallions** or green onions
* 1 cup **parsley**

Blend until smooth, about **1-2 minutes**. You may need to add more water.

Add to the dutch oven:

* 1 tbsp extra virgin **olive oil**
* 4 garlic **cloves**, minced

Sauté until translucent and fragrant, about **1-2 minutes**.

Add:

* 2 tbsp **Jamaican Green Seasoning**, above
* 1 teaspoon **salt**
* Pinch of **black pepper**

Stir until combined.

Add blended greens and:

* 1 **celery** stalks, chopped
* 2 fresh **thyme** sprigs
* 1 **scotch bonnet pepper**, whole
* 3 baby Yukon or Russet **potatoes**, peeled and cubed
* 1 tsp **sugar**

If you don't want it too spicy, then make sure the scotch bonnet doesn't break open. You want the whole pepper to give some flavour without opening up and pouring out spice. If you want it spicy, then chop up another seeded scotch bonnet.

Bring to a boil and then reduce heat to low. Simmer for about **12 minutes**. Soup won't be done yet, because we need to cook with the dumplings.


# Jamaican Spinner Dumplings 

Whisk together in a clean bowl:

* 1 cup all-purpose **flour**
* 0.5 tsp of **salt**

Drip in a bit at a time:

* up to 6 tbsp filtered **water**, only as much as necessary

Don't add all the water at once! Drip it in and knead until a stiff dough forms. If the dough is too moist the dumplings will fall apart in the soup.

Pinch small pieces of dough and roll in your hands to make a quarter-sized ball. Repeat for remaining dough.

Add the dough balls to the soup and stir them in gently. Simmer for **10 minutes** until potatoes are tender and dumplings are cooked through.

Taste for seasoning. May need more salt.

Remove from heat, discard thyme sprigs, and serve.
