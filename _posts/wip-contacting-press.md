Check out [Games Press](https://www.gamespress.com/nl/About-Games-Press) for
posting press releases. Make sure you have a presskit so interested journalists
have screenshots and information.

Some articles to help with writing your press release: [Hey indie devs, here's
how to contact the
press!](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/28a0u5/hey_indie_devs_heres_how_to_contact_the_press/)
and [Getting Your Game Noticed (Is Very, Very
Hard)](https://buried-treasure.org/2020/10/getting-your-game-noticed-is-very-very-hard/).

If you follow any industry news or gaming websites, then you should keep track
of which people like games *similar* to yours so you can contact them directly
about your game since they're more likely to be interested.

Probably worth checking out something like
[presskit.html](https://pixelnest.io/products/presskit.html/). It's like the
old presskit(), but as a static site so you can host for free as Github Pages
or any other hosting site.
