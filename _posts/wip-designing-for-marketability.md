You may have heard of The Clark Tank (discussions of game marketability from the
creator of NecroDancer), but if you're not interested in catching a live show on
Twitch, they [post edited versions on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUPKuAVC8PO7uIGiDCHUZGDNYAyRmW6NC) (looks like
they cut down the Forager episode [from three
hours](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/421675604?collection=DbcIuKCGnBWQTw&t=0h0m1s)
to [1
hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_AQhUSIHOE&list=PLUPKuAVC8PO7uIGiDCHUZGDNYAyRmW6NC&index=21)).

A lot of Clark Tank discussion is centred around the initial [How to
Consistently Make Profitable Indie
Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlAc5sBtGkc&list=PLUPKuAVC8PO7uIGiDCHUZGDNYAyRmW6NC&index=2&t=16s)
talk that I think is summarized in Clark's old article [What Makes An Indie
Hit: How To Choose The Right
Design](https://gamasutra.com/blogs/RyanClark/20150917/253842/What_Makes_an_Indie_Hit_How_to_Choose_the_Right_Design.php).
The idea is you come up with hooks for your game (something surprising and
desirable) and then analyse the market to see if it's viable.

# Hooks

Something surprising and desirable.

# Anchors

[Know your game's
anchor](http://howtomarketagame.com/2019/12/23/know-your-games-anchor)
introduces the concept of "anchors". In summary:

> While you want [hooks for your game (something surprising and
> desirable)](https://gamasutra.com/blogs/RyanClark/20150917/253842/What_Makes_an_Indie_Hit_How_to_Choose_the_Right_Design.php),
> you also need things that are familiar to players to help them quickly
> understand your game. Often this is elements that make the game similar to
> ones players enjoy (UI elements, mechanics, identifiable genre), but it can
> also be adjacent to the game: positive word of mouth from people they trust
> or the game is made by a developer they trust.
>
> You need to tell your potential buyers “Hey look at this cool twist, but you
> are still going to enjoy it because it is just like this other game that you
> played and your friends like it and that streamer played it for 10 hours
> straight.”


[How to find your
anchors](http://howtomarketagame.com/2020/01/06/how-to-find-your-anchors)
expands and discusses how to identify your anchors in order to understand what
you're designing:

> 1. Identify games in the genre that over-performed and under-performed on Steam. ([technique link](http://howtomarketagame.com/2019/12/11/how-i-do-competitive-analysis-for-my-game/))
> 1. Look at each Steam page.
> 1. Read all negative reviews.
> 1. Read any positive review that used the “Pros / Cons” format to find more ways to improve.
> 1. Note all pain points and praise from multiple reviews.
> 1. Watch a few video reviews to hear what average gamer types like / don’t like about some games.
> 1. Compile notes into a single list.

> Now that you have identified all the anchors you shouldn’t follow all of
> them. That would make your game boring and predictable. Instead, when you
> violate them do it on purpose and have an alternative that solves the same
> problem.
