I've never liked tomato soup. I think I've only had it from a can and never
enjoyed the intense sour flavours. I didn't like tomatoes as a kid either, so
maybe that's what initially turned me off.

# Soup

Get the croutons in the oven after prepping other ingredients but before
starting the soup.

In a large pot over medium-high heat, melt:

* 2 tbsp **butter**

Add:

* 1 yellow **onion**
* 4 sprigs **thyme**
* 2 cloves **garlic**, smashed
* 2 tsp **salt**

Cook stirring frequently until translucent. About 10 minutes.

Stir in

* 2 tbsp **flour**

Mix until completely incorporated.

Add:

* 825 mL (28 oz can) **crushed tomatoes**
* 2.75 cup chicken **stock**
* 0.33 cup **heavy cream**

Stir well and bring to boil.

Lower heat to simmer and cook for 20 minutes. This will help bring together the flavours.

Turn off the heat and remove and discard the thyme stems. Add:

* 280 g **cheese**

one handful at a time. Whisk after each addition until melted before adding the next.

Season to taste with:

* **salt and pepper**

Serve with:

* 1 poached **chicken breast** (or leftovers)
* 2 cups **croutons**


# Croutons

You can use store bought croutons, but try these home-made ones using some old bread.

Preheat oven to 375Â°F.

Line a sheet pan with aluminum foil or a silicone mat.

In a bowl, whisk together:

* 3 tbsp **butter**, melted
* 1 clove **garlic**
* 3 tbsp Dijon **mustard**
* 1 tbsp fresh **tarragon** (or parsley)
* 1 tsp **salt**

Add:

* 4 **buns** preferably potato, torn into crouton-sized pieces

and thoroughly toss to coat evenly.

Spread the bun bits in a single layer on the sheet pan.

Bake, stirring every 5 minutes, until crisped and browed. About 30 minutes.
