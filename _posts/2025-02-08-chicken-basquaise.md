I've never heard of this dish before reading about it in Food IQ, but it's
perfect for cold days and you can add more chorizo if you want even more heat.
My family doesn't handle spice too well, this version is pretty mild.

Season:

* 4 whole **chicken legs**
* with 4 tsp **salt**

rub **salt** all over and set **chicken** aside for 1 hour (or overnight in the
fridge).

Heat:

* 3 tbsp extra virgin **olive oil**

in a Dutch oven or large pot over high heat until shimmering. Add **chicken
legs** skin side down. Cook until browned, about 6 minutes. Flip to brown on
the second side, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

Lower heat to medium and add:

* 6 cloves **garlic**, smashed
* 55 g (2 oz) **chorizo** (double if you like spicy), thinly sliced
* 0.5 **red onion**, cut into 1.5 cm dice
* 3 stalks **celery**, chopped
* 1 **bell pepper**, chopped

Stir frequently and cook until onion is translucent, about 8 minutes.

Add:

* 1 tsp **paprika** (preferably sweet)

stir to combine.

Deglaze the pot:

* 0.5 cup dry **red wine**

Ensure the heat is high enough for the wine to boil. Scrape up the fond
(carmelized bits on the bottom of the pan) and then cook until wine is almost
entirely gone, about 5 minutes.

Add:

* 1 can (355 mL) **tomatoes** with juices
* 1.5 cup **chicken stock**
* 2 **bay leaves**

bring to a simmer. Turn heat to medium low, place the **chicken legs** in the pot,
loosely cover with a lid, and simmer for 1 hour. The chicken should be tender
but not so long that it's falling of the bone.

Serve with:

* 4 cups warm cooked white **rice**
