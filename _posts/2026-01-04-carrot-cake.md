I'm a big fan of carrot cake and this is the best I've ever tasted. The cake is super moist and the icing makes a great combo.

Choose either pecans or walnuts and blitz them in a food processor to crush them quickly.

# Cake

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Drain into a bowl:

* 398 mL can of **crushed pineapple**

Add to pineapple juice:

* 1 cup **raisins**

Set raisin mixture aside to soak.


Add to pineapple chunks:

* 5 shredded **carrots**

Set carrot mixture aside.

Add to mixer bowl:

* 1 cup **pecans** or **walnuts**, crushed
* 1 cup **white sugar**
* 1 cup **brown sugar**
* 1 cup **veg oil**
* 2 tsp **cinnamon**
* 2 tsp **vanilla extract**
* 4 **eggs**

Mix well.

Add to mixer bowl:

* 2 cups all-purpose **flour**
* 2 tsp **baking soda**
* 2 tsp **baking powder**

Mix.

Add carrot pineapple mixture and fold into batter.

Drain the raisin mixture and add the *raisins* to the mixing bowl. (Use the pineapple juice for some other recipe!)

Pour into 9x13 pan.

Bake 350°F for **45-55 minutes**.


# Icing

Add to clean mixer bowl:

* 1 block (250 g) **cream cheese**
* 0.25 cup **butter**

Mix.

Add to mixer bowl:

* 1 tsp **vanilla extract **
* 1 tbsp **heavy cream**
* 1.5 cups **icing sugar**

Mix with fork.


Fold in:

* 0.25 cup **pecans**, crushed

Spread icing on top of warm slices of cake to let it melt over the sides.
You can refrigerate the icing separate from the cake to make every serving have cool icing melted over warm cake.

# About


I reduced Mrs Brown's icing to half because it made a ton: enough for at least two cakes.

Next time I'll try using less oil and try sprinking the pecans on top of the icing instead of mixing them in.



Mrs Brown says you can completely omit the raisins but also omit the pineapple juice (and only use the chunks).
