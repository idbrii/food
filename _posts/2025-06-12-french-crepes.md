A chef named Kevin came to my son's class to teach them to make traditional French crepes. This recipe is my best recollection of the recipe.

He recommended ordering vanilla bean online (Amazon, etc) rather than vanilla extract. Or vanilla paste. If you must use vanilla extract (like me :/), then add 1 tsp.

# Brown butter

In a crepe pan or other flat pan, melt:

* 1/2 brick (1 lb) unsalted butter
* 1/2 brick (1 lb) salted butter 

Once lightly browned, will smell nutty. Remove from heat and move to a bowl. Do *not* wash the pan.


# Crepes

In a bowl, mix in this order:

* 4 cup **flour**
* 1 tbsp **sugar**
* 4 **eggs**
* 1/2 **vanilla bean**
* **Lemon** zest

Once loosely combined, stir and pour in:

* 4 cup **milk**

Heat pan to medium heat.

Add very thin layer of brown butter in pan (use a paper towel), pour mix, rotate pan to coat evenly, when it starts crisping at the edges flip over. Wait a bit flip back.

Put on plate. Brush with butter and sprinkle sugar. Fold in half and in half again. 

Eat from crispy edge not cone tip so butter doesn't leak out!
