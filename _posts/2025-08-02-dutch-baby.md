A Dutch baby is the pancake's more presentable cousin. Also, you get to cook a big one at once instead of a bunch of single servings. But you need a bunch of pans to cook more than four people.

He recommended ordering vanilla bean online (Amazon, etc) rather than vanilla extract. Or vanilla paste. If you must use vanilla extract (like me :/), then add 1 tsp.

# Batter

Add to a blender:

* 1 cup all-purpose **flour**
* 1 cup whole or 2% **milk**
* 4 large **eggs**
* 4 tbsp granulated **sugar**
* 1 tsp kosher **salt**
* 2 tsp **vanilla extract**

Blend for **10 seconds**.

Scrape sides and blend again. The batter should be loose and liquidy -- ready to pour.

Rest in blender for 20 min. While you wait, preheat the oven and pan.


# Cook

Remove any racks above the middle oven rack and put a 9 to 10-inch cast iron skillet on the middle rack.

Heat the oven to 425°F.

Add to the pan and melt:

* 4 tbsp unsalted **butter**

Pour in the batter, tilt the pan to coat the bottom evenly, and put in the oven. Bake for **15-20 minutes**.

Serve with:

* Powdered sugar, maple syrup, and jam, for serving
