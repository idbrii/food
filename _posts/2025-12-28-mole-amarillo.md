The original version of this recipe calls for chochoyotes: simple bread dumplings cooked in your simmering soup. But there wasn't enough liquid to properly cook the dumplings, so I've omitted them from this recipe.

Chilhuacles amarillos are the namesake of this dish, but if you can't get them even some canned **chipotle peppers** work. I use just one with some of the sauce and it's not very spicy.

Without the chochoyotes, it looks like this:

# Chiles

Add to a large saucepan:

* 3 large **chiles chilhuacles amarillos** or **chiles guajillos**, stemmed and seeded
* 1 cup **water**

On high heat, bring to boil. Cover the pot, remove from heat, and let sit for **30 minutes**. The chiles will soften. (Get crackin' on the chicken!)

Transfer chile mixture to a blender and puree until smooth. Set aside.

*If you use canned chiles, skip this step completely and add to the blender in the step below.*


# Mole

Add to a large heavy pot on medium-high:

* 2 tbsp **rendered lard** or **olive/veg oil**

Cook:

* 4 whole **chicken** legs

Brown the chicken, turning once. Around **9 minutes** total. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

In the same pot, add:

* 1 tsp black **peppercorns**
* 1 tsp dried **oregano**
* 0.5 tsp **cumin** seeds, toasted
* 4 **allspice berries** or 0.25 tsp **allspice**
* 1 whole **clove**
* 0.5 medium **white onion**, chopped
* 2 large fresh **yellow bell peppers** (or chiles güeros/carives/banana/wax)
* 3 medium **tomatillos** (or **tomatoes**), husked, rinsed, cored, and chopped.
* 6 **garlic** cloves, finely sliced or grated
* 2.25 tsp kosher **salt**
* 0.25 cup **cilantro** leaves, chopped (or 1 hoja santa leaf)
* 1 dried **bay leaf**

Stir occasionally to scrape up browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook until vegetables are tender but before they brown, about **7 minutes**.

Add:

* 3 cups **chicken stock**
* 1 handful of **tortilla chips**, crushed

Also add reserved chicken.

Bring to a boil, then reduce to medium-low, cover, and simmer until chicken is cooked through, about **40 minutes**. Chicken should be tender and falling off the bone. Transfer chicken to a bowl and let cool slightly.

Carefully add the remaining contents of the pot to a blender. Add the reserved amarillo chile puree. Puree until completely smooth. THis is your mole. Transfer to a large bowl.

Rinse and dry the pot. Return the mole to the pot and bring to a simmer on medium-low heat.

Add:

* 1.5 lbs **summer/winter squash** (eg., zucchini or butternut), peeled, seeded, and cut into 3 cm pieces
* 1 medium (yukon gold) **potato** or **chayote**, peeled (and seeded for chayote) and cut into 3 cm pieces

Simmer until cooked through, about **13 minutes**.

At this point, you could make [chochoyotes](https://www.thespruceeats.com/chochoyotes-recipe-5208980) and cook them in the mole.

Serve with the chicken over the mole.
