Polenta is pretty simple comfort food and this pressure cooker recipe makes it
easier without hours of stirring. You'll want some sides to help fill out this
meal.

Works pretty well as a make-ahead project: Cook the mushrooms the day before,
start the polenta on a timer in the morning, microwave the mushrooms when the
polenta is ready, and serve it all together.

# Mushrooms

Make the mushrooms ahead of time or while the polenta is cooking.

Trim the ends and cut into bite sized pieces:

* 0.75 kg (1.5 lb) **mushroom mix** (button, oyster, portabello, cremini, etc.)

Mince:

* 2 tbsp **shallot**

Heat oil in a large pan on high heat until it shimmers. Add all **mushrooms**
and set heat to medium and cover. Stir occasionally until they release their
liquid: about 4 minutes. Add **shallot** and:

* 1 tbsp **dried thyme** (or 2 sprigs fresh)
* 0.5 tsp **salt**

Continue cooking, stirring frequently, until liquid evaporates: about 6 minutes. Add:

* 0.5 cup dry **white wine** (red works too)

stirring frequently, until wine evaporates: about 1 minute. Add:

* 2 tbsp **butter**

stir until butter is melted and coated the mushrooms, remove from heat.
Discard thyme stems, if using.

# Polenta

You can mix this together in the morning and set an 8 hour delay on your
Instant Pot so it's ready for dinner.

In a pressure cooker, stir together:

* 7 cups **chicken stock**
* 2 cups coarse-ground **cornmeal**
* 1 tsp **salt** (or none if using salty bouillon)

Set to high pressure for **45 minutes**. Once done leave it with the lid sealed
for **1 hour** to naturally release the pressure and continue gentle cooking.

While it's cooking, grate:

* 0.5 cup grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano Reggiano cheese

Carefully remove the lid and dump any lid water in the sink. Stir in half the **cheese** and:

* 0.5 cup **heavy cream**
* 2 tbsp **butter**

Taste and add salt if necessary.

If too soupy, wait for 10 minutes. It should thicken as it cools.

Top each plate of **polenta** with **mushrooms**. Serve with remaining **cheese** and:

* **black pepper**
