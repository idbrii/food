WORK IN PROGRESS. I'm still working on writing this one.

	* They change gravity at different points in the jump to adjust how responsive it feels. They actually vary gravity with a curve, but I haven't gone that far yet. I think my last setup was to change gravity suddenly changes at the apex of the jump or when the user releases the jump button.

* Prototype visuals, you could try vertically squashing your character at the beginning of the jump and on land to give some visual difference between "taking off" and "soaring" without doing more animation.
