I'd recommend studying all high school math and university-level linear algebra (vector math, coordinate spaces). Calculus can be useful but probably more in getting your brain to think in different ways than directly applying calculus.

* [Immersive Math](http://immersivemath.com/ila/index.html) - interactive linear algebra book.
* [mathforgameprogrammers.com (archive)](http://web.archive.org/web/20221207074226/http://www.mathforgameprogrammers.com/) is a collection of gdc talks about math. The archive doesn't have all the latest links, but the current version is down and looks to get updated this year.
* [betterexplained.com](https://betterexplained.com/archives/) for lots of math articles that try harder to explain better.
* [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://gamemath.com/book/intro.html) for a big book of many math topics.
