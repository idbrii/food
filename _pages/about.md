Hi, I'm David.

I'm a game programmer and amateur chef. I've grown tired of trying to find the
same recipe and remember my modifications to it (usually doubling to feed my
family), so I created this website is mostly to archive recipes I really liked.

My programmer side loves clear organization so I'm trying something different
for my recipe layouts. While I loved the tables of [Cooking for
Engineers](www.cookingforengineers.com/), I want something that displays better
on my phone -- my constant cooking companion. I've styled the recipes on this
site after The Joy of Cooking. I really like how they list ingredients with the
recipe steps so it's easier to glance at what you're supposed to add.

This food site is built on [reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie) and Jekyll.
